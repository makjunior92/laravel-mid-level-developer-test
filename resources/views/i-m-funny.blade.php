        <p style="color: red"> 6a. What do you think about the current condition of software development in bangladesh 
            and how this differ from the other developed countries? Also put a comment how we can 
            improve ourselves as a giant digital developed nation in this field?</p>

        <p>Answer: The software industry is one of the most promising sectors of Bangaldesh with a vast number of young 
            professionals, very supportive environment from the government, strong leadership from BASIS and strong
            influence of marketing and advertisement. According to BASIS, today this software industry's net worth is around
            $400 million which is not an inconsequential amount at all.As per BASIS there are almost 800 registered 
            along with a couple of 100 unregistered IT companies. Most of the software comapnies in Bangladesh are 
            involved in outsourcing. So, these companies have a strong influence in our economy.     
        </p>

        <p>
            Bangladesh is a small country with. We can not say that our software industry is huge comparing to other
            developed countries. There are lot of setbacks in our country. For example, there's a huge electricity 
            shortage in our country. Although officially it is refferred that electricity coverage is 95% nationwide
            but practically it's ruthless. First of all, to establish a healthy software industry we have to have 
            uninterrupted power service nationwide. Then we have to have the internet facility all over the country 
            and it has to accessible for all.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Bangladesh is really advancing in the software industry in the last few years. New companies are starting up 
            and giving young generation a lot of opportunities which is solving the unemployment problem a lot.
            Even people from different educational background are getting involved in building softwares.
            I think it's a matter of time that Bangladesh will become a leader in software industry in South East Asia.

            How its possible to equally distribute these 3 fish among all of them without piecing 
            and without killing any of them?</p>

        <p>Answer: Their relationship is grandfather -> father -> son. 
            Grandfather's son is the father, and the father's son is the son, 
            which makes them 3 people basically. So, each of them will get 1 fish. </p>
